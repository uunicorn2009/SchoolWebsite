Believing that every child has a special flair, we strive to bring out the best sports person in every child. A well-structured games programme for all students for mental and physical toughness is in place.The Community Service Project is a continuous program of our school. At DWPS Agartala we endeavor to make a positive contribution to the underprivileged communities by supporting a wide range of socioeconomic, educational and health initiatives Through our various projects, the school, complete with its staff and students, embrace the responsibility towards the community and environment (both ecological and social) in which it operates.Excursions and trips have an educational element which gives students a chance to experience new environments and enjoy a day away from the classroom. Absence of fear and a joy of discovery in trips and excursions make learning in such informal environment pleasurable. Teachers design modules and study of different aspects of the central theme, topic and objective. Students are made to record observations through written as well as visual means followed by a presentation once they return from the trip.At DWPS Agartala, we provide a safe and friendly learning environment. The principal teaching block is earthquake and fire-resistant. Electric wires running through the school are FRLS (fire-resistant, low-smoke) cables with high insulation. A large number of smoke detectors and fire extinguishers are located across strategic points. The electric sub-station is placed more than 100m from the school building (as against a fire norm of 5-10m). CCTV cameras and a high-mounted surveillance system help teachers monitor student safety at all times.Our school has a fleet of comfortable and safe buses equipped with GPS tracking system. A teacher/ helping staff accompanies the children in the bus and each bus has medical kit for any emergency. In case of any delay parents are informed through SMS.
